XP-ExclusionMaker
=================

Makes exclusion sceneries for X-Plane

With the growing number of default airports in x-plane there is a need to generate some helper sceneries. These sceneries have to be loaded after the default sceneries but before the custom sceneries.

The ExclusionMaker generates the exclusions automaticaly.
